## What?

A whitelist proxy that uses socat. ðŸ”ŒðŸ˜¼

## Why?

tl;dr: To workaround https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/36174.

Basically, Docker supports internal networks; but when you use them, you simply cannot open ports from those services, which is not very convenient: you either have full or none isolation.

This proxy allows some whitelist endpoints to have network connectivity. It can be used for:

- Allowing connection only to some APIs, but not to the rest of the WWW.
- Exposing ports from a container while still not letting the container access the WWW.

## How?

Use these environment variables:

### `TARGET`

Required. It's the host name where the incoming connections will be redirected to.

### `MODE`

Default: `tcp`

Set to `udp` to proxy in UDP mode.

### `MAX_CONNECTIONS`

Default: `100`

Limits the maximum number of accepted connections at once per port.

#### Setting "unlimited" connections

For each port and open connection a subprocess is spawned. Setting
a number too high might make your host system unresponsive and prevent you from
logging in to it. So be very careful with setting this setting to a large number.

The typical linux system can handle up to 32768 so if you need a lot more
parallel open connections make sure to also set the corresponding variables
on your host system. See
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6294133/maximum-pid-in-linux for reference.
And divide this number by at least the number of ports you are running through
 docker-whitelist.

#### What happens when the limit is hit?

docker-whitelist basically starts `socat` so the behaviour is the same. In case
no more subprocesses can be forked:
 * UDP mode: You won't see a difference on the connecting side. But no more
 packets are forwarded for new connections until the number of connections for
 this port is reduced.
 * TCP mode: docker-whitelist no longer accepts the connection and your
 connection will wait until the number of connections for this port is reduced.
 Your connection may time out.

### `NAMESERVERS`

Default: `208.67.222.222 8.8.8.8 208.67.220.220 8.8.4.4` to use OpenDNS and Google DNS resolution servers by default.

Only used when [pre-resolving](#pre-resolve) is enabled.

### `PORT`

Default: `80 443`. If you're proxying HTTP/S services, no need to specify!

The port where this service will listen, and where the [target](#target) service is expected to be listening on also.

### `PRE_RESOLVE`

Default: `0`

Set to `1` to force using the specified [nameservers](#nameservers) to resolve the [target](#target) before proxying.

This is especially useful when using a network alias to whitelist an external API.

### `UDP_ANSWERS`

Default: `1`

`1` means the process will wait for an answer from the server before the forked child process terminates (until this happens the connection counts towards the connection limit).
Set to `0` if no answers are expected from the server, this prevents subprocesses waiting for an answer indefinitely.

Setting to `0` is recommended if you are using this to connect to a syslog server like graylog.

### `VERBOSE`

Default: `0`

Set to `1` to log all connections.

## Example

So say you have a production app called `coolapp` that sends and reads emails, and uses Google Font APIs to render some PDF reports.

It is defined in a `docker-compose.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
# Production deployment
version: "2.0"
services:
    app:
        image: Tecnativa/coolapp
        ports:
            - "80:80"
        environment:
            DB_HOST: db
        depends_on:
            - db

    db:
        image: postgres:alpine
        volumes:
            - dbvol:/var/lib/postgresql/data:z

volumes:
    dbvol:
```

Now you want to set up a staging environment for your QA team, which includes a fresh copy of the production database. To avoid the app to send or read emails, you put all into a safe internal network:

```yaml
# Staging deployment
version: "2.0"
services:
    proxy:
        image: traefik
        networks:
            default:
            public:
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
            # Here you redirect incoming connections to the app container
            - /etc/traefik/traefik.toml

    app:
        image: Tecnativa/coolapp
        environment:
            DB_HOST: db
        depends_on:
            - db

    db:
        image: postgres:alpine

networks:
    default:
        internal: true
    public:
```

Now, it turns out your QA detects font problems. Logic! `app` cannot contact `fonts.google.com`. Yikes! What to do? ðŸ¤·

`tecnativa/whitelist` to the rescue!! ðŸ’ªðŸ¤ 

```yaml
# Staging deployment
version: "2.0"
services:
    fonts_googleapis_proxy:
        image: tecnativa/whitelist
        environment:
            TARGET: fonts.googleapis.com
            PRE_RESOLVE: 1 # Otherwise it would resolve to localhost
        networks:
            # Containers in default restricted network will ask here for fonts
            default:
                aliases:
                    - fonts.googleapis.com
            # We need public access to "open the door"
            public:

    fonts_gstatic_proxy:
        image: tecnativa/whitelist
        networks:
            default:
                aliases:
                    - fonts.gstatic.com
            public:
        environment:
            TARGET: fonts.gstatic.com
            PRE_RESOLVE: 1

    proxy:
        image: traefik
        networks:
            default:
            public:
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
            # Here you redirect incoming connections to the app container
            - /etc/traefik/traefik.toml

    app:
        image: Tecnativa/coolapp
        environment:
            DB_HOST: db
        depends_on:
            - db

    db:
        image: postgres:alpine

networks:
    default:
        internal: true
    public:
```

And voilÃ ! `app` has fonts, but nothing more. âœ‹ðŸ‘®
